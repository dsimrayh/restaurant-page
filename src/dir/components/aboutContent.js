    1: `Here at Dorado Grill, we consider ourselves as an essential part of the history of Islamorada. We first opened our doors back in 1965, when the founder (and passionate angler), Damian Simrayh, decided to take action towards realizing his dream of owning a renowned seafood restaurant. Since our establishment, we've maintained a unwavering commitment to Mr. Simrayh's motto - "Good food, good service, good deeds, and good vibes".`,

    2: `Soon after Dorado Grill was founded, our name quickly became a staple of great restaurants - not just in the Keys, but in the whole state of Florida! To this day, we continue to do our best to provide one of the highest rated dining experiences in the Keys - both for our local residents and all of our out-of-town guests. Come visit us - by boat or by land - and see what we're all about! You won't be disappointed.`,

    3: `At Dorado Grill, we pride ourselves on serving only the freshest, highest quality seafood - most of which is sourced locally from Florida waters! Each dish has its own unique flair, and you will find that everything on our menu is exploding with rich, delicious tropical flavors that really give you a taste of that local island cuisine that you're craving!`,

    4: `In addition to our standard menu items, we also offer the "Catch of the Day" menu, which allows our guests to choose from an array of fish and shellfish that are caught and brought to us fresh every single morning by local anglers! With a variety of preparation options and the unmatched freshness - we can assure you it doesn't get much better than this!`,

    5: `Staying true to our founder's motto - we also place a great emphasis on supporting our local community. We host many fundraisers and events throughout the year with the goal of collecting money that is used to positively impact our hometown. 100% of these funds are donated to local schools, libraries, community centers, non-profits, and food banks among other things.`,
    
    6: `In addition to this, a portion of all of Dorado Grill's revenue is donated directly to natural conservation efforts! As our founder Mr. Simrayh was an extraordinarily passionate outdoorsman, he wanted his legacy to continue on long after he was gone in a way that positively impacted the thing he held nearest and dearest to him - our extraordinary planet!`,
