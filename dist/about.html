                    About Dorado Grill
                </div>
                <div class="information-ptag">
                    Here at Dorado Grill, we consider ourselves as an essential part of
                    the history of Islamorada. We first opened our doors back in 1965, when
                    the founder (and passionate angler), Damian Simrayh, decided to take action 
                    towards realizing his dream of owning a renowned seafood restaurant. Since our 
                    establishment, we've maintained a unwavering commitment to Mr. Simrayh's motto - 
                    "Good food, good service, good deeds, and good vibes". 
                    <br><br>
                    Soon after Dorado Grill
                    was founded, our name quickly became a staple of great restaurants - not just in
                    the Keys, but in the whole state of Florida! To this day, we continue to do our best
                    to provide one of the highest rated dining experiences in the Keys - both for our local 
                    residents and all of our out-of-town guests. Come visit us - by boat or by land - and
                    see what we're all about! You won't be disappointed.

                <div class="information-ptag">
                    At Dorado Grill, we pride ourselves on serving only the freshest, highest quality
                    seafood - most of which is sourced locally from Florida waters! Each dish has its 
                    own unique flair, and you will find that everything on our menu is exploding with
                    rich, delicious tropical flavors that really give you a taste of that local island
                    cuisine that you're craving! 
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to our standard menu items, we also offer the "Catch of the Day" menu, 
                    which allows our guests to choose from an array of fish and shellfish that are 
                    caught and brought to us fresh every single morning by local anglers! With a variety
                    of preparation options and the unmatched freshness - we can assure you it doesn't 
                    get much better than this!

                    Giving Back
                </div>
                <div class="information-ptag">
                    Staying true to our founder's motto - we also place a great emphasis on supporting our
                    local community. We host many fundraisers and events throughout the year with the goal 
                    of collecting money that is used to positively impact our hometown. 100% of these funds 
                    are donated to local schools, libraries, community centers, non-profits, and food banks
                    among other things. 
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to this, a portion of all of Dorado Grill's revenue is donated directly to 
                    natural conservation efforts! As our founder Mr. Simrayh was an extraordinarily passionate
                    outdoorsman, he wanted his legacy to continue on long after he was gone in a way that 
                    positively impacted the thing he held nearest and dearest to him - our extraordinary planet!

                    our yearly events and fundraisers as well as explain our conservation efforts in great detail.
